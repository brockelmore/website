# Info

this is my personal site. mostly used for writing. feel free to use it for yourself

much thanks to [@fiveoutofnine](https://github.com/fiveoutofnine) - many style components are direct ports of his design work.


# Blog

i use MDX just like 5/9 does, but svelte instead of react. just add mdx posts in `src/posts`.




```bash
npm i
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
