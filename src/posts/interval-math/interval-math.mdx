## Introduction to Interval Arithmetic & Analysis

Interval arithmetic is a form of abstract algebra over an interval of values instead of concrete values.
That is to say, instead of $$x + x$$ where `x` is a number like $5$, interval arithmetic replaces the $$5$$
with a representation of a range of values like $$x ∈ [0, 10]$$.
<br>

_note: $$∈$$ just means "in", and $$[\_, \_]$$ means interval, where the left-hand side number is the lower bound
and the right-hand side is the upper bound, with an assumed step of size 1. So $$x ∈ [10, 100]$$ reads as "x is in
the range from 10 to 100". For example:_


<Range name={"x"} start={10} end={100} locked={true} showU8={false}/>


## Applications to Programming Languages

Applying the concepts of interval arithmetic to code can provide some
interesting insights:
1.  Possible under or overflow
2.  Precision loss analysis
3.  Access control issues
4.  Data Validation issues


When applying interval arithmetic to code, there are assumptions and rules that could be enforced by the compiler onto
the arithmetic that is being performed. Default intervals on variables can take lesser or greater bounds, execution may
halt due to checked arithmetic, etc. When applying interval arithmetic to code, these assumptions and rules can generate
constraints that are useful in analyzing the security of the program.


## Application to Solidity

Solidity has 8 builtin types:
1.  `uintX`
2.  `intX`
3.  `bytesX`
4.  `address`
5.  `bool`
6.  `bytes`
7.  `string`
8.  arrays

*note: technically there are some additional internal compiler types
like `rational_const`, `int_const`, and `uint_const`*.

Each of these type will have a default interval. `uintX`, `intX` and `bytesX` are special because they can
have multiple sizes. For example, a `uint8` has 8 useable bits. Its default interval can be represented as such:

<Range name={"uint8"} locked={true}/>

or $$uint8 ∈ [0, 255]$$.

In general, applying interval analysis to solidity allows us to know the possible values that an input, variable, or output could be which
can play a large role in either manually or automatically finding bugs in code. Knowing just the default interval is not helpful though, so we have
to look at operations that affect a variable and it's interval.

### Solidity Arithmetic Operations

Solidity supports all normal math operations:

  **Operation**            |**Symbol**
  -------------------------|------------
  $$Addition$$             |$$+$$
  $$Subtraction$$          |$$-$$
  $$Multiplication$$       |$$*$$
  $$Division$$             |$$/$$
  $$Modulus$$              |$$\%$$
  $$Exponentiation$$       |$$**$$

In addition to arithmetic operations, we can also define interval operations
over memory, bitwise, and logical domains -- but I will save that for another time.

Lets look at an example of interval arithmetic under solidity.

### Interval Addition in Solidity
By default, all of these operations are *checked*, meaning overflows and underflows throw a revert. Here, we add
two `uint8`s and return the result.

```solidity
function add(uint8 a, uint8 b) internal returns (uint8) {
    return a + b;
}
```
Here is a visualization of the above operation:

<Addition lhs_name={"a"} rhs_name={"b"}/>

Notice how when $$a_{min} + b_{min} > 255$$, the system turns red - this means solidity would
revert with a `Panic(0x11)` (arithmetic over/underflow).

Also notice how the other side's maximum changes when you change the minimum.
This is actually an important outcome of applying solidity's checked math to
our interval analysis. It generates constraints that can be used by SMT solvers
like Z3.

Checked addition is the simplest arithmetic operation in interval analysis. Below is a table showing that under addition, the resulting minimum
is just $$A_{min}$$ (denoted by $$v$$) + $$B_{min}$$ ( denoted by $$x$$), and the new maximum is $$A_{max}$$ (denoted by $$w$$) + $$B_{max}$$ (denoted by $$y$$).

**type**   |$$A$$<br>$$[ v, w ]$$                                        |$$B$$<br>$$[ x, y ]$$                                        |$$A + B$$
  ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------| ------------------------------
  `uint`     | $$[ 0, 2^{256} - 1]$$           | $$[ 0, 2^{256} - 1 ]$$           |$$[ v + x,w + y]$$
  `int`      | $$[ - 2^{255}, 2^{255} - 1 ]$$   | $$[ - 2^{255}, 2^{255} - 1 ]$$   |$$[ v + x,w + y]$$




### Shrinking Intervals

Another key part of solidity that affects intervals are `assert`s and `require`s. In this example, notice how we know have a
complete understanding of what range of values could be returned from this function:

```solidity
function add(uint8 a, uint8 b) internal returns (uint8) {
    require(a > 3);
    require(a < 10);
    require(b < 65);
    require(b > 50);
    return a + b;
}
```

<Addition lhs_name={"a"} rhs_name={"b"} lhs_start={4} lhs_end={9} rhs_start={51} rhs_end={64} locked={true}/>

This is beginning to be interval _analysis_.

### Code Reachability via Interval Analysis
As we apply interval arithmetic, and build up constraints on variables, we
have actually started interval analysis which can be used for code reachability evaluation.


```solidity
function add(uint8 a, uint8 b) internal returns (uint8) {
    require(a > 3);
    require(a < 10);
    require(b < 65);
    require(b > 50);
    if (a + b < 54) {
        assert(false, "unreachable")
    } else {
        return 1;
    }
}
```

As we showed above, the *minimum* possible value of `a + b` after the require statements
is 55. And so, we can determine that the true branch of the if statement is unreachable. What
is cool about this approach is we did not need to break out any SMT solvers to solve constraints
to determine this. We got code reachability analysis for "free"  by doing interval analysis (however, not all reachability is able to be
determined by interval analysis).


### Common Vulnerability Analysis

Interval analysis via `require`s and `assert`s, even without arithmetic, can also immediately highlight access control issues and data validation issues. Below
is an example of vulnerable code, take a second and try to find the issue.


```solidity
function mint(address to, uint amt) public onlyOwner {
    _transfer(address(0), to, amt);
}

function transferViaSig(bytes32 mhash, bytes32 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s, address to, uint amt) internal returns (bool) {
    address from = ecrecover(mhash, v, r, s);
    return _transfer(from, to, amt);
}

function _transfer(address from, address to, uint amt) internal returns (bool) {
    if (from == address(0)) {
        balances[to] += amt;
    } else {
        balances[from] -= amt;
        balances[to] += amt;
    }
    return true;
}
```


There is no validation on the address output from `ecrecover`. If the signature is invalid `ecrecover` will return `address(0)`. Via interval analysis,
we can track that `from` has the interval `[0x0000..0000, 0xffff..ffff]`, and effectively anyone can mint. If the code had a `require(from != address(0))`,
the interval would have been `[0x0000..0001, 0xffff..ffff]`, and the correct branch in `_transfer` would be hit.


### Other Operations

I really only dove deep into checked addition in this post, but each operation has its own quirks and generates unique constraints. If this was interesting
to you, I am writing [`pyrometer`](https://github.com/nascentxyz/pyrometer), which does interval analysis for all solidity operations
(checkout the [execution engine](https://github.com/nascentxyz/pyrometer/blob/90b03bbf4559c24f334b24613b0df51eaf9896a5/crates/graph/src/range/exec/exec_op.rs#L200) to see the implementation) - its undergoing a big
change right now and would love some help. Hit me up on [twitter/x](https://x.com/brockjelmore) or [telegram](https://t.me/brockelmore) to chat about it!

I also plan to write more here going forward so keep an eye out.
